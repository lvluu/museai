"""Usage: jumps.py video.mp4  -> one-frame picture jumps (exit 1 if any).
A jump is a frame whose luma change (signalstats YDIF) is > 3, > 5x the median of the
25 frames around it and > 2.5x both neighbours: the picture snaps (reframe, zoom, pose)
between two frames. Too small for qa's hard-cut detector, but the user sees it as a glitch.
EP09 v7: each clip seam jumped 17.3 (clips start ~3.7 % zoomed against the previous clip's
last frame) and muse clip B snapped 6 times inside the clip (YDIF 3-9); calm frames sit at
~0.6. Dissolves (xfade) spread the change over several frames and are not flagged.
Run it before burn_subs.py: each caption appearing or leaving is a one-frame jump too."""
